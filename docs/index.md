PsychWebTool is a JavaScript library for behavioral experimets. The PsychWebTool library can be used free of charge for both online and offline experiments in a modern web browser.

The consept of the library resembles that of [jsPsych](http://www.jspsych.org/) but the programing style is quite diffrent. As a result, the advantage of PsychWebTool is also diffrent from that of jsPsych. For example, PsychWebTool can easily present a stimulus which have not been used often in web-based experiments like a moving circle.

If you interested in core technologies which PsychWebTool is based on, please refer to [keywords: async, await, and promise](keywords.md).

# About PsychWebTool

PsychWebTool was created by Daiichiro Kuroki at Kyushu University in Japan. I am preparing submitting a paper regarding this library. Until acceptance of the paper, please cite the URL: http://pwt.hes.kyushu-u.ac.jp/ if you use PsychWebTool.

You can use PsychWebTool free of charge, but the software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.
