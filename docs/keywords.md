PsychWebTool is based on some new technology of JavaScript like async, await, and promise.

Promises are designed for programmers to clearly write a code involving complex asynchronous processes. It is well known that asynchronous processes often give rise to a complex JavaScript code named as "call back hell", and to prevent this problem promises is defined in [ECMAScript 2015](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/). A promise object can be stopped by calling with the await keyword in the async function. Note that sample codes shown in Table 1-X must written in the async function, and waitMsecs and keyDownCheck that are promise objects defined in an external file must be called with the await keyword. In programs of experimental psychology, there are many situations where you want to stop executing the code, for example, waiting for participants' responses, presenting stimuli for a while, or waiting for finishing of preloading images, and promise is of benefit to these situations. Table X is a list of functions of PWT which generate promise and require await keyword.
